# Huffman-Coding-MATLAB
This MATLAB project implements Huffman coding for source encoding. It calculates codewords, average code length, and coding efficiency for first-order, second-order, and third-order expanded sources. The project helps analyze compression efficiency and entropy for discrete source symbol probabilities.
